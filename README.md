# Sensor Node

This repository contains the software running on the sensor nodes.

The project is setup for PlatfomIO, and targets the NRF52840.

Currently the program will advertise over BLE when the SW button is pressed.
It will accept a connection, and then send a test message to the connected device when the SW button is pressed.
